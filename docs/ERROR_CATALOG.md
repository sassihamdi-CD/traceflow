# TracFlow Error Catalog — what each message means and what to do

Every API failure returns the same shape (see `app/errors.py`):

```json
{"detail": {"code": "publish_blocked", "message": "…", "hint": "…", "data": {}}}
```

- **message** — what happened, in plain words. Never a class name or number.
- **hint** — the next step. Follow it before contacting support.
- The screen always shows `message` + `hint`, never raw codes or JSON.

## Passport publishing

| code | You see | What to do |
|---|---|---|

| code | You see | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `already_decided` | This value was already accepted/rejected… | Refresh the page to see its current state. |

|---|---|---|
| `file_too_large` | This file is too big — the limit is N MB. | Compress, or split into smaller documents, and upload again. |

| `not_a_pdf` | …named .pdf but is not a real PDF file. | Re-export as PDF and upload again. |
| `not_a_workbook` | …named .xlsx but is not a readable Excel workbook. | Re-save from Excel as .xlsx and upload again. |

## AI services (extraction, Q&A, intake)
